### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m Sharon. At heart, Iâ€™m a problem solver â€”Â Iâ€™m passionate about solving deep, complex problems that our society faces. 

ðŸŒ± Particularly, Iâ€™m interested in problems relating to designing scalable and reliable software and big data systems. I have experience mostly working with backend engineering, distributed systems, and security. Currently, I'm volunteering at PuMP, as their head of technology, where I've built their new website and created training documents for students to break into programming. I've also interned at Salesforce, Faire, Kiavi, and Geotab.

ðŸ“« Iâ€™d love to listen and chat with other developers about their journeys in tech! Feel free to reach out or email me at sharonhe.dev@gmail.com.
