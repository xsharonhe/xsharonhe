### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Sharon, and I love exploring how technology can be used to develop data-driven business solutions. I fell in love with building software because I believe in technology's ability to develop creative solutions for the complex issues our society faces. Currently, I'm volunteering at PuMP, as their head of technology, where I'm building their new website and creating training documents for people to break into programming, and Unitic, building a machine-learning based diagnostic tool for Tourette's Syndrome.
- âš¡ I have experience working on full-stack web development projects, and Python for data science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently delving into natural language processing (NLP), mobile programming, and cloud computing (e.g. GCP, AWS)
